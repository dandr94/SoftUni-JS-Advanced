### Files
These are the raw files that I created through the course JS-Advanced. The fundamentals course is here because I was learning the syntax with it.
JS Applications tasks are possible by using the SoftUni practice server. You can find it [HERE](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server).<br/>
`Important: these files are NOT all the tasks that were given to solve. Some of them are missing (especially Applications tasks) and some of them are not tested in Judge.`
